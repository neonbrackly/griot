  title: Griot Registry - Contracts API (Missing Endpoints)
  description: |
    This specification documents the API endpoints that are **MISSING** from the griot-registry
    but are **REQUIRED** for the Contracts Agent tasks (T-CON-001 through T-CON-010).

    ## Existing Endpoints (Already Implemented)

    These endpoints exist and work:
    - `GET /contracts` - List contracts with pagination
    - `GET /contracts/{id}` - Get contract detail
    - `POST /contracts` - Create contract (ODCS format)
    - `PUT /contracts/{id}` - Update contract (full replace)
    - `POST /contracts/validate` - Validate contract YAML/JSON
    - `GET /issues` - List issues
    - `POST /runs` - Create validation run

    ## Missing Endpoints (Need Implementation)

    The endpoints below are needed for:
    - **T-CON-002**: Reviewer assignment on contract creation (needs /users, /teams)
    - **T-CON-003**: Contract status workflow (submit, approve, reject)
    - **T-CON-004**: Quality rules, version history, audit trail
    - **T-CON-008/009/010**: Schema editing with re-approval workflow

    ## Implementation Priority

    1. HIGH: Status workflow endpoints (submit, approve, reject, deprecate)
    2. HIGH: Extended Contract response with reviewer fields
    3. MEDIUM: Quality rules endpoints (list, create, update, delete)
    4. MEDIUM: Version history endpoint
    5. MEDIUM: Tasks endpoint (for re-approval workflow)
    6. LOW: Audit trail endpoint

    ## Already Implemented (auth-admin-api.yaml)
    - GET /users - List users (for reviewer dropdown)
    - GET /teams - List teams (for reviewer dropdown)

  # ===========================================================================
  # NOTE: USER AND TEAM ENDPOINTS
  # ===========================================================================
  # GET /users and GET /teams are provided by the Auth/Admin API
  # See: agents/specs/auth-admin-api.yaml
  #
  # The contracts frontend uses these endpoints for reviewer assignment:
  # - GET /users - List users for reviewer dropdown
  # - GET /teams - List teams for reviewer dropdown
  #
  # These are ALREADY IMPLEMENTED in auth-admin-api.yaml
